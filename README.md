# WalkThru
In storage, it is required that you do a "Walk Through" of the facility to ensure the Property Management software reflects the current status of the physical facility. 
This app will be used to allow its users to elevate their facilites and ensure that they are kept clean and are properly documented.

This is my first app so it's a work in progress. 

The goal for this app is to have a sign in page to start, then after users first sign in, it will allow them to type in their units (ex. 0001-0457, 0500- 1563) and will populate a list. This list will be of buttons with each button being an individual unit number. Once pressed, the button will change to yellow and will populate a text box for the user to write in a custom note for that specific unit. There will also be options to have a drop down list for specific notes to increase speed. These notes can be custimized by user per facility. Once the user is finised using the app, they will be able to export it to either email, cloud storage, or print the results to allow the user to input results into their specific propertry mangement software. 

Goals:

Increase speed of walk throughs to allow more time in office.
Decrease money spent on paper and pens.
Increase the level of professionalism when it comes to facility upkeep/cleanliness.
Allow users to pay for more advance features (export/remove ads, etc.)
